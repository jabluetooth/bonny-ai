# Interactive Portfolio Website

An AI-powered, database-driven portfolio built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**, designed to present my skills, projects, and experience through natural language interaction instead of static pages.

Visitors can ask questions and receive dynamic, context-aware responses that trigger visual UI components.

---

## Key Highlights

- **AI Chat Portfolio** – Natural language interface for exploring my work and background  
- **Database-First Design** – Skills, projects, and experiences are stored and queried from PostgreSQL  
- **Dynamic UI Rendering** – Chat responses control frontend components in real time  
- **Admin Dashboard** – Secure Google OAuth login for managing content and conversations  
- **Polished UX** – Responsive design & animations

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js 15
- React, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Framer Motion

**Backend & AI**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS)
- LLM-powered chat (Groq / OpenAI-compatible)
- Intent-based context fetching & response optimization

---

## What I Learned

- Designing **scalable full-stack architectures** using a database-first approach  
- Building **secure authentication and role-based access** with Supabase and middleware  
- Integrating **LLMs beyond simple chat**, including intent detection and UI triggers  
- Optimizing AI usage by balancing **deterministic logic and generative responses**  
- Creating **user-focused interfaces** where AI enhances UX rather than replaces it

## Why This Project

This project showcases my ability to:
- Build production-ready full-stack applications  
- Apply AI in a practical, user-facing way  
- Think about performance, security, and maintainability  
- Design experiences that are both technical and human-centered
